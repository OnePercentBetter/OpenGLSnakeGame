I built a snake game that revolves around a small arrow moving around to capture food. As it captures the food, it grows. As it grows and you move around, you can see that the tail or the rest of the body follows where the snake head once was perfectly. I implemented window boundaries so that if it goes out of bounds, the game ends. I also made it so that the head can't go into the body, such as say you're going left and you want to go right so you click right button. Instead of the snake head going into the right direction despite it's body, it'll stop and do nothing. Some interesting things I implemented includes a count of food eaten at the top right corner and a GameOver ending picture that briefly appears before the window closes.  The game does not have the lines drawn vertically/horizontally and is designed to be as simple as possible. I think I could've added a background to match a typical snake game but I was out of time. The Foods are placed randomly based on the size of the screen.
